                    <h2>Watching Football</h2>
                    <p>An ardent football fan since 2014 FIFA WC, I'm literally in love with the sorcerer, Leo Messi. 
                       I follow barca, their tiki-taka legacy and their fluid attacking DNA.<br> Regardless of the style of football I follow, clean and intelligent defending is what matters most for me.
                       My dream as a football fan is to watch a wc match of India, with our flag dancing in my hands.

                    <h2>Reading Novels</h2>
                    <p>
                        The very first novel I raed was the Harry Potter series, and ever since, I am truly addicted to reading masterpieces. Mostly fantasy, my favourite ones are Harry Potter, The Greatest: My Story, few Rick Riordan books and The Hounds of Baskerville(Sherlock Holmes).

                    <h2>Dancing</h2>
                    <p>
                        My greatest fantasy in life is to set a big crowd demanding "once more" from me after a dance performance... <br>
                        I enjoy imitating MJ(Michael Jackson) dance steps and freestyle.
                        I am inspired by the innovative dance style of Michael Jackson and his presentation, and thanks to this inspiration, I love dancing.

                        Kimetsu no Yaiba, Full-Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Deathnote are the only ones I've completed, as it's still new love. Whenever I get some leisure time, anime is mostly what I end up Watching with my friends.
